    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I have over eight years of experience in web development, about two years of experience in web application development, and a year experience in mobile application development. I am a reliable self-starter and I take pride in and excel at being able to grasp new concepts quickly and work my way through difficult problems. I believe that while being skilled in the technical side of things is obviously important, effective communication with your peers is important as well. I have plenty of experience assisting clients with technical issues and bridging the gap between the tech-savvy and those who aren't so technologically inclined.</p>

    <p>I am a leader who relishes the opportunity to tackle a new task head on and lead by example. I have experience handling projects on my own, beginning with speaking with clients and understanding what they want and need, all the way through the development and the presentation of the finished product. I also have a great deal of experience working as part of a team, and effectively delivering high quality solutions to clients.</p>

    <p>The bulk of my experience comes from working for Carter Solutions, who has a proven track record of delivering cost-effective, high quality website development, mobile development and custom programming solutions to private and public organizations large and small since 1995. I also have experience on the freelance side of things, and have independently designed (using Adobe Photoshop) and developed websites for several businesses and organizations using a number of Content Management Systems.</p>

    <p>Not only do I understand the technical side of the business, I also understand the marketing and financial side. I have sales experience and have even led a marketing campaign for Carter Solutions, where I facilitated the agreement of several contracts, and worked to bring the finished products to fruition.</p>

    <p>My most recent experience comes from my time as a Software Engineer at OnSolve where I contributed to the development and maintenance of three separate iOS and Android applications built using the React Native framework and capable of delivering high volumes of messages via multiple communication methods across 29 different locales/languages.</p>

    <p>Technology is a passion of mine, and growing my knowledge everyday is not only something that I strive to do, but that I am grateful for. I am always actively seeking new opportunities to challenge myself and grow as a developer and a person.</p>
