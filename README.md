  Andre's Portfolio React Web App
</h1>

Welcome to my GitHub repository for my React Web App Portfolio. Feel free to browse these files or use them for your own learning.

_You can visit the deployed web app [here](https://www.andrecartertech.com)._

This application has been developed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA). That means that this website can be downloaded to your device and used just like a native app. A few benefits of PWA's are that they can be used without an internet connection, they take up much less space on your device, and they load extremely quickly. Click <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/content/hearingloss/installPWA.html">here</a> to learn how you can install my app to your phone as a PWA.
